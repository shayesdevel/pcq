   - Assesses customer risk profiles and compliance requirements

5. Implementation Strategy (5_implementation.md)
   - Details the technical approach to quantum-resistant algorithms
   - Outlines business impact management and performance considerations
   - Presents risk management framework and testing protocols

6. Execution Framework (6_execution.md)
   - Presents the four-phase implementation approach
   - Details stakeholder engagement and success metrics
   - Outlines industry leadership positioning

7. Next Steps (7_next_steps.md)
   - Summarizes strategic priorities and immediate actions
   - Presents implementation framework and performance management
   - Details stakeholder coordination requirements
