# Post-Quantum Cryptography: Securing Our Network's Future

## Primary Message
Our network security demands immediate preparation for the quantum computing era, requiring a strategic transition to post-quantum cryptographic standards.

## Secondary Message
This presentation outlines our comprehensive approach to implementing NIST-approved post-quantum cryptography solutions while maintaining network performance and reliability.

## Key Points
1. Quantum Computing Advancement
   Current quantum computing advancements are outpacing industry predictions, creating immediate implications for our network security infrastructure. The accelerating development timeline requires proactive preparation and strategic planning.

2. Present Security Risks
   "Store now, decrypt later" threats pose a significant risk to our long-term data integrity. This vulnerability creates an urgent need for quantum-resistant cryptographic implementation across our network infrastructure.

3. Implementation Requirements
   Our transition strategy must address several critical components:
    - Detailed analysis of NIST-approved algorithms: CRYSTALS-Kyber, CRYSTALS-Dilithium, FALCON, and SPHINCS+
    - Comprehensive transition framework with minimal service disruption
    - Resource allocation and infrastructure requirements assessment
    - Structured implementation across assessment, planning, pilot, and deployment phases
    - Clear milestones and success metrics for tracking progress
    - Industry coordination and partner engagement strategy
