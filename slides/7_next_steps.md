# Securing Our Quantum Future: Next Steps

## Primary Message
The time for quantum security preparation is now â€“ our structured approach ensures we stay ahead of both technological advancement and market expectations.

## Secondary Message
Our comprehensive strategy protects our network's future while strengthening our market position through demonstrated security leadership.

## Key Points

1. Strategic Priorities and Infrastructure Analysis
   Our quantum security implementation begins with a targeted infrastructure audit that maps critical upgrade paths and resource requirements. This foundation enables efficient resource allocation across high-priority systems, with clear milestones tracking our progress toward quantum readiness. By focusing first on critical infrastructure, we maximize security impact while maintaining operational stability through each implementation phase. The audit process reveals both technical dependencies and business process impacts, creating a comprehensive view of our transition requirements.

2. Implementation Framework and Performance Management
   Our execution strategy balances swift deployment with operational reliability through precise performance thresholds and coverage targets derived from our risk assessment. Each phase incorporates industry-standard security validation protocols while maintaining the flexibility to adapt to emerging requirements. This measured approach ensures service continuity while systematically expanding our quantum-resistant security coverage. Real-time monitoring and automated adjustments maintain service levels throughout the transition, with clear escalation paths for any performance deviations.

3. Stakeholder Engagement and Coordination
   Success depends on coordinated action across business units, enabled by technical training programs and established communication channels. Each unit's designated security representative facilitates implementation while structured review cycles ensure consistent progress. This framework provides clear escalation paths and enables rapid process refinement based on operational feedback. Our communication strategy ensures all stakeholders understand both their responsibilities and the broader context of our quantum security transition.
